    1. In chart_utils.py, use SnowflakeConnection object instead of snowflake.connector
    2. For every page, add a new file <page>_modal.py
    3. Add Data Cards as separate rows

Whenever a page is added, following steps to done:
    0. Add from . import <pagename>   that corresponds to the <pagename.py>
    1. For each view or query that the page needs to handle,
        add code in tasks.py to populate the redis cache using the following convention
        Key: <table_name>
        Field: DATASET
    2. Create a new python file <page_name>.py that matches with menu item and place it in pages folder
    3. Make sure chart_utils.get_loaded_data() function is used and no database call is explicitly made in <page_name>.py
    4. Create a new python file <page_name>_modal.py  that handles all modal actions - lot of work is needed here
    5. Index.py - Add menu item
    6. Index.py - Add a new entry correspond to the menu item in display_content function
    7. Add page_name and data_table_name to the modal function so that when comments is submitted, it gets updated
